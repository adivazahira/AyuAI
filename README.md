# AyuAI - A GenAI Chatbot for Elderlies
My team and I developed a GenAI conversational companion chatbot software for elderlies, created a product MVP, and demonstrated its value with a business pitch and a technical report. 

AyuAI was inspired by my grandmother, Ayu, and the growing global ageing problem and loneliness. There are 3 main segments to AyuAI. First, a Speech-To-Text LLM to convert the user's speech to the input text. Second, the input text wil be fed into a text-generation model (Mistral-7b) using the HuggingFace Inference API. Third, the generated text will be converted into speech using Google's Python package gTTS for quicker inference times.

We presented our business pitch infront of 3 industry judges at University of Washington, Foster School of Business in March of 2024. We received honorable mention for best product and business presentation, as well as "Investor Relations Mastery" for our responses during the Q&A session with our judges.

Credits to my wonderful teammates, Wei Shun Soong for his technical contributions with the code, as well as Bethany Ortiz, Devesh Khurana, and Alice Marshall for their contributions to the product and business plan development.
